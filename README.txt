These assignments have been done for an Interactive Computer Graphics course at UCLA. The coding projects are built off of the coding samples provided by the textbook “Interactive Computer Graphics: A Top-Down Approach with WebGL” by Edward Angel and Dave Shreiner. The textbook’s coding samples can be found at  http://www.cs.unm.edu/~angel/BOOK/INTERACTIVE_COMPUTER_GRAPHICS/SEVENTH_EDITION/
